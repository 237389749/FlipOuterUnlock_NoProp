/**
 * Completely remove the fliphome widget overlay window so it never appears.
 *
 * Logic chain (refMD: Gesture_Widget_Overlay.md §3):
 *
 *   Every show/hide decision funnels through a single choke point:
 *
 *     CheckAppConfigRunnable.postRefreshWindow()  ┐
 *     setSupportWatchForNull()                    ├→ refreshWindow(action, withAnimation)
 *     foreground-app change                       ┘        action: 1=ADD, 2=REMOVE
 *       → showHideWindow(show = action==1, withAnimation)
 *         → wm.addView(groupView)  /  wm.removeViewImmediate(groupView)
 *
 *   showHideWindow() is ONLY called from refreshWindow(), and addView() is
 *   ONLY called from showHideWindow() — so refreshWindow() is the single
 *   upstream funnel for every window add.
 *
 * Fix (single upstream point): rewrite every ADD(1) into REMOVE(2). The
 * window is then never added to WindowManager, so it neither draws nor
 * intercepts touches — the overlay is gone entirely, and the full screen
 * shows the content underneath (the app was always full-screen below it).
 *
 * removeViewImmediate() on a never-attached view is a safe no-op
 * (WindowManagerGlobal.findViewLocked(required=false) returns null), so
 * converting the very first ADD into a REMOVE cannot crash fliphome.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from WidgetTouchPassthrough:
 *   - This feature       → widget never appears at all
 *   - Touch passthrough  → widget stays visible, touches pass through it
 *   (When both are active this one dominates — the window is never added.)
 *
 * Defensive layers (block wm.addView, GONE, 1×1) are NOT included — add
 * only if testing shows the widget still appears via some undocumented path.
